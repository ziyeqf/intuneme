??? question "`intuneme init` fails with \"disk quota exceeded\" on Fedora"
    Fedora and many systemd-based distros mount `/tmp` as a tmpfs (RAM-backed) with a size limit. The container image export can exceed this limit.

    Use `--tmp-dir` to write temporary files to a disk-backed directory:

    ```bash
    intuneme init --tmp-dir /var/tmp
    ```

    The same flag is available on `intuneme recreate`. Alternatively, set the `TMPDIR` environment variable:

    ```bash
    TMPDIR=/var/tmp intuneme init
    ```

??? question "`intuneme shell` fails on Fedora/Bazzite (SELinux)"
    `intuneme init` handles this automatically: it relabels the rootfs as `container_file_t` and installs a policy module that grants `systemd-machined` the PTY access it needs for `machinectl shell`.

    If you upgraded from an older install and did not re-run `init`, use the provided script:

    ```bash
    bash scripts/fix-selinux.sh
    ```

    Alternatively, re-run initialization:

    ```bash
    intuneme init --force
    ```

??? question "intune-portal crashes with \"No authorization protocol specified\""
    The Xauthority file is not being forwarded into the container. Check that your host has an Xauthority file in `$XAUTHORITY` or `/run/user/$UID/`.

    Common file name patterns to look for:

    ```bash
    ls /run/user/$UID/.mutter-Xwaylandauth.* /run/user/$UID/xauth_* 2>/dev/null
    ```

    If no file is found, your compositor may not be creating one. Try restarting your graphical session.

??? question "intune-portal shows error 1001 or \"UI web navigation failed\""
    The Microsoft Identity broker services are not running inside the container. Open a shell and check their status:

    ```bash
    intuneme shell
    ```

    Inside the container:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status microsoft-identity-device-broker
    systemctl --user status microsoft-identity-broker
    ```

    If either service has failed, restart it:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart microsoft-identity-device-broker
    systemctl --user restart microsoft-identity-broker
    ```

??? question "Compliance check fails"
    The intune-agent timer may not be running. Inside the container:

    ```bash
    intuneme shell
    ```

    Then:

    ```bash
    systemctl --user start intune-agent.timer
    /opt/microsoft/intune/bin/intune-agent
    ```

    Running the agent directly will output diagnostic information if it encounters an error.

??? question "Edge crashes with \"Trace/breakpoint trap\""
    This is almost always a corrupted browser profile, not a GPU or sandbox issue.

    First, test with a fresh profile:

    ```bash
    microsoft-edge --user-data-dir=/tmp/edge-test
    ```

    If Edge launches successfully with a fresh profile, the issue is the existing profile. Move it aside and restart Edge:

    ```bash
    mv ~/.config/microsoft-edge ~/.config/microsoft-edge.bak
    ```

    Edge will create a new profile on next launch.

??? question "Chinese text shows as boxes or Fcitx5 cannot input Chinese in Edge"
    Chinese rendering requires CJK fonts in the container image. Current images include Noto CJK fonts and UTF-8 locales; if you are on an older image, update with:

    ```bash
    intuneme recreate
    ```

    The default Edge launcher uses native Wayland and enables Chromium's Wayland input-method path. On KDE Plasma, make sure Fcitx 5 is selected in System Settings -> Virtual Keyboard. On GNOME, make sure Fcitx 5 is running in the host session.

    You can also force a Wayland text-input protocol version:

    ```bash
    intuneme open edge --wayland-text-input-version 3
    ```

    If native Wayland input still does not work for your compositor, use the XWayland/XIM fallback:

    ```bash
    intuneme open edge --x11
    ```

    This uses the host XWayland/XIM bridge and sets Fcitx-related input variables for Edge. XWayland can still be used from a Wayland desktop.

??? question "No sound in Edge or other container apps"
    Check that PipeWire is forwarded. The host needs a PipeWire socket at `/run/user/$UID/pipewire-0`:

    ```bash
    ls -la /run/user/$UID/pipewire-0
    ```

    Inside the container, verify the `PIPEWIRE_REMOTE` environment variable is set:

    ```bash
    intuneme shell
    echo $PIPEWIRE_REMOTE
    ```

    If PipeWire is not running on the host, start it:

    ```bash
    systemctl --user start pipewire pipewire-pulse
    ```

??? question "Webcam not available in Teams or Edge"
    Check that udev rules are installed:

    ```bash
    ls /etc/udev/rules.d/70-intuneme-video.rules
    ```

    If the file is missing, install the rules:

    ```bash
    intuneme udev install
    ```

    Verify the camera is detected on the host:

    ```bash
    ls /dev/video*
    ```

    Check device forwarding logs for errors:

    ```bash
    journalctl -t intuneme-hotplug
    ```

??? question "`intuneme start` fails with \"broker proxy failed to start within 5 seconds\""
    The broker proxy process did not write its PID file in time. This usually means the D-Bus session bus is not available or there is a port/socket conflict.

    Check that the session bus is running:

    ```bash
    echo $DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS
    ```

    If the variable is empty, you are likely running outside a desktop session. The broker proxy requires an active D-Bus user session.

    You can also check broker proxy logs:

    ```bash
    journalctl --user -u dbus -n 20
    ```

    If the container started successfully but the proxy did not, you can disable the proxy and restart:

    ```bash
    intuneme config broker-proxy disable
    intuneme stop && intuneme start
    ```

??? question "`intuneme` commands fail with a config.toml parse error"
    If `config.toml` contains invalid TOML syntax, intuneme will report the error instead of silently falling back to defaults. This prevents unexpected behavior from a corrupted configuration.

    Check your config file for syntax errors:

    ```bash
    cat ~/.local/share/intuneme/config.toml
    ```

    Common causes include unquoted strings, missing closing quotes, or stray characters from a manual edit. Fix the syntax or delete the file and re-run `intuneme init` to regenerate it.

??? question "YubiKey not detected inside the container"
    Check that udev rules are installed:

    ```bash
    ls /etc/udev/rules.d/70-intuneme-yubikey.rules
    ```

    If the file is missing, install the rules:

    ```bash
    intuneme udev install
    ```

    Verify the key is detected on the host:

    ```bash
    lsusb | grep Yubico
    ```

    Check device forwarding logs:

    ```bash
    journalctl -t intuneme-hotplug
    ```

    If the key was plugged in before the container started, it should have been forwarded automatically at boot. If not, unplug and re-plug the key while the container is running to trigger the hotplug rules.
